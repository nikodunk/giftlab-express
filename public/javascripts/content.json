    "Researcher": "Callie Veelenturf",
    "Project Description - Short": "Discover and protect the wonders of the Eastern Pacific leatherback sea turtle.",
    "Project Description - Long": "With your donations we will conduct research to better understand prehistoric giants; the Eastern Pacific leatherback sea turtle. For our research we will study these incredible creatures above and below the water to better estimate their population size, movements and behaviors, migration patterns, fishery interactions and nesting behaviors. The footage and information from these studies will also be used to create a platform for community outreach, fundraising and conservation campaigns.",
    "Researcher profile": "Armed with a Masters of Science in Biology, Callie is determined to prevent the Eastern Pacific Leatherback sea turtle from extinction. As a research fellow at the Turtle Island Restoration Network in California, she spends her days researching and collecting data on these incredible animals in order to understand how to best protect them and influence government policy change for their long-term survival.",

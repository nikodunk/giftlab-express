In four years we have created 10 different surfing programs at 7 title 1 schools including. During these programs our youth are given the opportunity to learn how to swim, surf, and to why it is important to respect the environment. We will go on over 150 surf outings in 2018, serving over 400 youth. Although we work with schools we are not funded by them. We look to the community to help us continue to grow and share the stoke with more youth.",

This inspired Johnny to transform his teaching skills from the classroom to the ocean, and City Surf Project was born.",
